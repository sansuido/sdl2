/// Load an audio format into a music object, assuming a specific format.
///
/// SDL_mixer has two separate data structures for audio data. One it calls a
/// "chunk," which is meant to be a file completely decoded into memory up
/// front, and the other it calls "music" which is a file intended to be
/// decoded on demand. Originally, simple formats like uncompressed WAV files
/// were meant to be chunks and compressed things, like MP3s, were meant to be
/// music, and you would stream one thing for a game's music and make repeating
/// sound effects with the chunks.
///
/// In modern times, this isn't split by format anymore, and most are
/// interchangeable, so the question is what the app thinks is worth
/// predecoding or not. Chunks might take more memory, but once they are loaded
/// won't need to decode again, whereas music always needs to be decoded on the
/// fly. Also, crucially, there are as many channels for chunks as the app can
/// allocate, but SDL_mixer only offers a single "music" channel.
///
/// This function loads music data, and lets the application specify the type
/// of music being loaded, which might be useful if SDL_mixer cannot figure it
/// out from the data stream itself.
///
/// Currently, the following types are supported:
///
/// - `MUS_NONE` (SDL_mixer should guess, based on the data)
/// - `MUS_WAV` (Microsoft WAV files)
/// - `MUS_MOD` (Various tracker formats)
/// - `MUS_MID` (MIDI files)
/// - `MUS_OGG` (Ogg Vorbis files)
/// - `MUS_MP3` (MP3 files)
/// - `MUS_FLAC` (FLAC files)
/// - `MUS_OPUS` (Opus files)
///
/// If `freesrc` is non-zero, the RWops will be closed before returning,
/// whether this function succeeds or not. SDL_mixer reads everything it needs
/// from the RWops during this call in any case.
///
/// As a convenience, there is a function to read files from disk without
/// having to deal with SDL_RWops: `Mix_LoadMUS("filename.mp3")` will manage
/// those details for you (but not let you specify the music type explicitly)..
///
/// When done with this music, the app should dispose of it with a call to
/// Mix_FreeMusic().
///
