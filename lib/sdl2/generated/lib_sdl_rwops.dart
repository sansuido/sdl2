/// Use this function to create a new SDL_RWops structure for reading from
/// and/or writing to a named file.
///
/// The `mode` string is treated roughly the same as in a call to the C
/// library's fopen(), even if SDL doesn't happen to use fopen() behind the
/// scenes.
///
/// Available `mode` strings:
///
/// - "r": Open a file for reading. The file must exist.
/// - "w": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
/// already exists its content is erased and the file is treated as a new
/// empty file.
/// - "a": Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the
/// file. The file is created if it does not exist.
/// - "r+": Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must
/// exist.
/// - "w+": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
/// the same name already exists its content is erased and the file is
/// treated as a new empty file.
/// - "a+": Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are
/// performed at the end of the file, protecting the previous content to be
/// overwritten. You can reposition (fseek, rewind) the internal pointer to
/// anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move it
/// back to the end of file. The file is created if it does not exist.
///
/// **NOTE**: In order to open a file as a binary file, a "b" character has to
/// be included in the `mode` string. This additional "b" character can either
/// be appended at the end of the string (thus making the following compound
/// modes: "rb", "wb", "ab", "r+b", "w+b", "a+b") or be inserted between the
/// letter and the "+" sign for the mixed modes ("rb+", "wb+", "ab+").
/// Additional characters may follow the sequence, although they should have no
/// effect. For example, "t" is sometimes appended to make explicit the file is
/// a text file.
///
/// This function supports Unicode filenames, but they must be encoded in UTF-8
/// format, regardless of the underlying operating system.
///
/// As a fallback, SDL_RWFromFile() will transparently open a matching filename
/// in an Android app's `assets`.
