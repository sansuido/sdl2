/// Dynamically load the Vulkan loader library.
///
/// This should be called after initializing the video driver, but before
/// creating any Vulkan windows. If no Vulkan loader library is loaded, the
/// default library will be loaded upon creation of the first Vulkan window.
///
/// It is fairly common for Vulkan applications to link with libvulkan instead
/// of explicitly loading it at run time. This will work with SDL provided the
/// application links to a dynamic library and both it and SDL use the same
/// search path.
///
/// If you specify a non-NULL `path`, an application should retrieve all of the
/// Vulkan functions it uses from the dynamic library using
/// SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr unless you can guarantee `path` points
/// to the same vulkan loader library the application linked to.
///
/// On Apple devices, if `path` is NULL, SDL will attempt to find the
/// `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` address within all the Mach-O images of the current
/// process. This is because it is fairly common for Vulkan applications to
/// link with libvulkan (and historically MoltenVK was provided as a static
/// library). If it is not found, on macOS, SDL will attempt to load
/// `vulkan.framework/vulkan`, `libvulkan.1.dylib`,
/// `MoltenVK.framework/MoltenVK`, and `libMoltenVK.dylib`, in that order. On
/// iOS, SDL will attempt to load `libMoltenVK.dylib`. Applications using a
/// dynamic framework or .dylib must ensure it is included in its application
/// bundle.
///
/// On non-Apple devices, application linking with a static libvulkan is not
/// supported. Either do not link to the Vulkan loader or link to a dynamic
/// library version.
