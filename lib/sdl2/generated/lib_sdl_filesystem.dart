/// This is not necessarily a fast call, so you should call this once near
/// startup and save the string if you need it.
/// 
/// **Mac OS X and iOS Specific Functionality**: If the application is in a
/// ".app" bundle, this function returns the Resource directory (e.g.
/// MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/). This behaviour can be overridden by adding
/// a property to the Info.plist file. Adding a string key with the name
/// SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE with a supported value will change the
/// behaviour.
/// 
/// Supported values for the SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE property (Given an
/// application in /Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app):
/// 
/// - `resource`: bundle resource directory (the default). For example:
/// `/Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app/Contents/Resources`
/// - `bundle`: the Bundle directory. For example:
/// `/Applications/SDLApp/MyApp.app/`
/// - `parent`: the containing directory of the bundle. For example:
/// `/Applications/SDLApp/`
/// 
/// The returned path is guaranteed to end with a path separator ('\' on
/// Windows, '/' on most other platforms).
/// 
/// The pointer returned is owned by the caller. Please call SDL_free() on the
/// pointer when done with it.

/// 
/// This function will decide the appropriate location in the native
/// filesystem, create the directory if necessary, and return a string of the
/// absolute path to the directory in UTF-8 encoding.
/// 
/// On Windows, the string might look like:
/// 
/// `C:\\Users\\bob\\AppData\\Roaming\\My Company\\My Program Name\\`

/// Both the org and app strings may become part of a directory name, so please
/// follow these rules:
/// 
/// - Try to use the same org string (_including case-sensitivity_) for all
/// your applications that use this function.
/// - Always use a unique app string for each one, and make sure it never
/// changes for an app once you've decided on it.
/// - Unicode characters are legal, as long as it's UTF-8 encoded, but...
/// - ...only use letters, numbers, and spaces. Avoid punctuation like "Game
/// Name 2: Bad Guy's Revenge!" ... "Game Name 2" is sufficient.
///

/// Windows, '/' on most other platforms).
